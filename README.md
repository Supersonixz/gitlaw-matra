# Matra (มาตรา)

**Matra** is a project born from a simple question: *Why is it so hard to see how our laws have changed?*

## The Motivation

Thailand has had over 20 constitutions in its history. Each version reflects the political landscape and the will of the people at that time. However, for the average citizen, understanding these changes is incredibly difficult. Comparing legal texts manually is tedious, prone to error, and often requires specialized knowledge.

We believe that **transparency is the foundation of democracy**. If people cannot easily see what has changed in their supreme law, they cannot fully participate in the democratic process.

## Our Goal

We created **Matra** ("Section" in Thai) to make Thai Constitutions **accessible** and **transparent**.

We rely on technology not to show off, but to solve a human problem:
- **To Visualize**: Transforming dense text into clear, color-coded visual comparisons.
- **To Understand**: Helping people see not just *what* changed, but *where* and *how*.
- **To Empower**: Giving students, researchers, and citizens a tool to explore their own history without barriers.

## How it Works

Matra provides a clean interface to compare any two versions of the Thai Constitution side-by-side.

- **Semantic Awareness**: It tries to understand the structure of the law, matching sections intelligently even if the wording or numbering shifts slightly.
- **Visual Clarity**: Changes are highlighted (Green for additions, Red for removals) so you can spot differences instantly.
- **Accessibility Focus**: We've designed it to be fast and responsive, ensuring that even large documents with hundreds of sections can be browsed smoothly by anyone, on any device.
